%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	
%	Directions for using this bibliography to reference an Areva document:
%
%	Make sure that the document is listed in this file (use CTRL+F to search for the Doc ID)
%	In a LaTeX prepared document, type \cite{DOC NUMBER}, where "DOC NUMBER" is replaced
%		 by the actual document number, without the doc ID prefix or the rev number postfix.
%
%		Example: To cite document 86-1266272-04, use "\cite{1266272}" without quotation marks.
%		
%	
%	To reference a non-Areva document:
%
%	Find the document in this file (use CTRL+F to search for an ID number, or some other part of the name)
%	Find the code immediately after the first "{" in the bibliography entry (labeled "CITATION" below)
%	In a LaTeX prepared document, type \cite{CITATION}, where CITATION is replaced by the code
%		from the bibliography entry.
%
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%		
%
%	To use this bibliography, the following code should be placed in the LaTeX document and uncommented:
%
%		%----------- References Section ------------
%		\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}
%		\label{References}
%		\bibliographystyle{Resources/latex/areva/areva}
%		\bibliography{References} % reads References.bib
%		%-------------------------------------------
%	
%	When the document is created, the reference list should appear where the code was placed in the document.  
%	This is typically at the end of the document, but before any appendices.
%
%
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%
%	Directions for adding to the reference list:
%
%		For any company documents, use the following syntax:
@COMMENT{		manual{NUMBER,}
%			author = company,
%			note = "ID-NUMBER-REV"
%			title = "TITLE"
%			}
%		replacing NUMBER, ID, REV, and TITLE with the appropriate document number, doc ID, revision number, and title of the document.  The string "company" is a variable that has the current name of Areva (or whatever the current company name is).
%
%		For any other documents, use the following syntax:
@COMMENT{		@manual{CITATION,}
%			author = "",
%			note = "ENTIRE CITATION"
%			title = ""
%			}
%		Where ENTRIE CITATION is the entire citation, in the appropriate format.
